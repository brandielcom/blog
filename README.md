### Code Analyse

[PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) focuses on finding errors in your code without actually running it. It catches whole classes of bugs even before you write tests for the code. It moves PHP closer to compiled languages in the sense that the correctness of each line of the code can be checked before you run the actual line.   
The following composer command is alias to `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --level 8 src`

    composer analyse


### Coding Standards


[PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) has been
configured to detect violations of the defined coding standards for the
application.

To validate your code with the default configuration (see `phpcs.xml.dist`)
simply run:

    vendor/bin/phpcs
